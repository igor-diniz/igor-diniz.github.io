# **About Me**

Hi. I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:.<br>
I am currently studying computer engineering at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto and I am attending my second year there. I am passionate about technology, and even more about artificial intelligence. I love programming and I work well in groups, because I know how to listen and learn when necessary, as well as I know how to lead, especially by example, when I have more knowledge about a specific subject. I am very motivated, but mainly disciplined. I like to think big and try to reach bigger and bigger goals in my personal and professional life. I invite you to get to know me better, and to find out more about who Igor is who writes here.
